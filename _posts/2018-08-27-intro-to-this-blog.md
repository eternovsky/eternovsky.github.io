title: "What the heck is this thing?"

Hi. My name is Evgeny and I work as a Program Manager on the [Azure Log Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/log-analytics/) team. There, I very commonly will help in putting KQL queries together for various real-world problems. These queries can be very useful for others, and moreso, the thought process leading to their creation is a valuable learning tool. On a selfish note, putting these together is something I quite enjoy doing: each one is a puzzle and a challenge onto itself, with a very satisfactory feeling after having solved a difficult one.

This little blog will hopefully serve to both help you and document my own query "wins". I will try to post something new every week or so, though some weeks might have multiple interesting topics, and others none.

Check out the resources tab to see a bunch of tools out there for you to learn and play around with KQL, as well as info about how to get in touch. With that said, here's the customary Hello World in KQL - let's get going!:

{% highlight powershell %}
print "hello world"
{% endhighlight %}
